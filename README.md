# AceMarketing

AceMarketing is a first-party marketing intelligence, activation, enrichment and attribution platform being implemented from the workflow and product concepts documented in the EasyInsights material supplied for this project.

The implementation stays on the **main** branch. No parallel implementation branch is required for the current build.

## Current implementation status

### Marketing website
- Responsive enterprise SaaS landing page
- Lead-quality, conversion-leakage and attribution problem framing
- Journey-stitching + agent operating model
- AdSync, Enrich and Klarity-style core modules
- 11-agent catalogue
- Integration ecosystem
- Industry/use-case sections
- Case-study presentation for EdTech, healthcare, high-AOV commerce and home services
- Diagnostic section for business, tracking/data quality and ad optimization
- Demo-request form
- Login experience

### Product workspace
The interactive workspace currently includes:
- Overview / acquisition command center
- AdSync
- Conversion Event Manager
- Customer Journeys
- Full-path Attribution
- Enrich / lead grading
- Agent Library
- Integrations
- Audience Management
- Monitoring
- Workspace Settings

### API foundation
A local zero-dependency Node API is included at `server/index.mjs`.

Available demo endpoints:
- `GET /api/health`
- `POST /api/auth/login`
- `POST /api/demo-requests`
- `GET /api/workspace/overview`
- `GET /api/integrations`
- `GET /api/events`
- `GET /api/journeys`
- `GET /api/attribution`
- `GET /api/agents`
- `GET /api/audiences`
- `GET /api/monitoring`

The Vite development server proxies `/api` to `http://127.0.0.1:3001`.

## Run locally

Install packages:

```bash
npm install
```

Terminal 1 — API:

```bash
npm run api
```

Terminal 2 — frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open:

```text
http://localhost:5173
```

The API health endpoint is:

```text
http://localhost:3001/api/health
```

## Build and type-check

```bash
npm run check
npm run build
```

## EasyInsights parity areas represented

The supplied product material describes:
- stitching online and offline customer journeys;
- server-side conversion activation;
- Google offline/enhanced conversions;
- Meta CAPI-style conversion delivery;
- CRM-context enrichment;
- call and WhatsApp attribution;
- audience activation and suppression;
- continuous event synchronization;
- full-path attribution;
- prebuilt funnel agents.

Those capabilities are represented in the current AceMarketing product UI and API foundation.

## Production work still required

This repository now has the front-end product experience and API contract foundation, but the following are still required before calling it production-ready:

1. Persistent database and migrations
2. Real user authentication and RBAC
3. Workspace and tenant isolation
4. OAuth for Google, Meta, LinkedIn, CRM and messaging connectors
5. Secure credential vault / secret management
6. Tracking SDK and server-side event ingestion
7. Identity graph / deterministic stitching
8. GCLID and FBCLID persistence
9. Real Google ECL/OCI delivery
10. Real Meta Conversions API delivery
11. Retry queues, dead-letter handling and idempotency
12. CRM ingestion and stage mapping
13. WhatsApp and telephony ingestion
14. Attribution computation engine
15. Audience synchronization workers
16. Agent runtime and approval workflow
17. Audit logs and compliance controls
18. Monitoring/alerting and operational dashboards
19. Billing and usage metering
20. Automated tests, CI/CD and production deployment

## Brand and IP note

AceMarketing reproduces comparable product workflows, capabilities, navigation patterns and visual direction under its own identity. Third-party proprietary source code, logos, screenshots, customer marks and copyrighted assets are not bundled into this repository unless separately licensed or provided with permission.


## Latest parity implementation

This pass adds brochure-driven parity for AdSync operations:

- **Channel / campaign funnel mapping** with stage-level counts from lead through booking.
- **24×7 live sync view** for CRM, calling, WhatsApp and advertising-platform signal transfer.
- **Brochure expected-impact section** covering the five AdSync improvement levers and the supplied 45% compounded-impact model.
- **Browser tracking SDK foundation** that persists GCLID/FBCLID and sends page/event payloads to the local API without blocking UX.
- **`POST /api/track`** ingestion endpoint.
- **`GET /api/funnel`** and **`GET /api/live-sync`** API endpoints.

### Tracking example

```ts
import { track } from './src/lib/tracker'

track({
  event: 'qualified_lead',
  customerId: 'crm-123',
  value: 0,
  currency: 'INR',
  properties: { stage: 'Qualified' }
})
```

Click identifiers are captured from the landing-page query string and persisted in browser storage for subsequent events. This is an implementation foundation; production use still requires consent handling, server-side identity storage, secure hashing, idempotency, queueing, retries, and real destination APIs.


## Offline attribution and connectivity parity

The current implementation now also covers the brochure's offline-conversion patterns:

- **Call attribution** using telephony timestamps matched against active website sessions and persisted click identifiers.
- **WhatsApp attribution** using persisted GCLID/FBCLID plus lead phone association.
- **Partial-payment conversion adjustment** for high-consideration journeys.
- **Platform-agnostic integration grouping** across CRM, WhatsApp/marketing, calling, website/app, advertising and analytics categories.
- New workspace tab: **Offline Attribution**.
- New endpoint: **`GET /api/offline-attribution`**.

The integration UI is now grouped to match the supplied brochure's connectivity structure instead of presenting one flat connector list.

## Current public-site parity pass

This pass was aligned against the current EasyInsights public homepage and pricing flow (checked September 2026), while preserving AceMarketing branding.

Implemented:
- Top benchmark/reference banner matching the public site's current 45% uplift positioning, clearly labeled as an external parity reference.
- Agent impact labels updated to mirror the metrics currently published on the EasyInsights public site.
- Agent category filters: **Lead Quality**, **Conversion**, and **Visibility**.
- Public proof-reference cards for Leverage Edu, India IVF and Blue Tokai, clearly labeled so the outcomes are not represented as AceMarketing customer results.
- Dedicated **Pricing / Stack Builder** page:
  - monthly lead-volume selector;
  - data-location selection;
  - data-challenge selection;
  - advertising-channel selection;
  - recommended-agent selection;
  - selected stack summary;
  - custom-quote state instead of invented prices.

The public pricing source exposes the configurator structure but not stable numeric agent prices in the crawled HTML, so AceMarketing intentionally shows **Custom quote** rather than fabricating pricing values.

### IP / claims handling

UI structure, information architecture and workflows are being reproduced for functional parity. EasyInsights trademarks, copyrighted screenshots, proprietary source code and customer logos are not copied into the repository. Third-party performance figures are labeled as public reference metrics rather than AceMarketing performance claims.
